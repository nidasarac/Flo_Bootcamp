This project is a sports application that aims to provide users with information about different sports and their respective leagues, teams, and players. The app has a user-friendly interface and features four popular sports, namely football, basketball, cricket, and tennis.

Upon launching the app, users can easily navigate through the different sports and select their preferred sport to view the list of available leagues. Each league's information is presented in three categories: Upcoming Events, Latest Results, and Teams.

For each team, the app provides a list of players. Users can also save their favourite teams, making it easier to keep track of their favourite teams and players.

The app is developed using Swift, a programming language for iOS app development. The app fetches data from APIs using threads, and the data is stored locally using CoreData and UserDefaults. CocoaPods is used to manage dependencies such as Alamofire, Kingfisher, Reachability, and lottie.

The app's UI is developed using UIKit and Constraints, making the app responsive across different device screen sizes. Version control is also implemented using GitHub, allowing the developers to collaborate efficiently and manage changes effectively. Overall, the app provides a convenient way for sports enthusiasts to stay updated on their favourite sports, teams, and players.
